## Projects in mind

### CircuitPython Online IDE based on vscode.dev
- Reason
    - vscode.dev have much better python IntelliSense, file management, and UI than my hand-crafted one
    - It looks like web-serial is supported in vscode extensions for cloud
- The audience: still Education
    - Otherwise, I am not motivated to make things online
- Goal:
    - pre-configured, aka, keep things simple
        - no installation of extension etc.
    - compatible with the whole vscode eco-system
        - users can install other extensions
        - users' experience can be transferred to other work, e.g., desktop-installed vscode.
